    <a href="https://game-master.net/">UO:Siege Perilous</a> Linux Launcher
</h1>

Linux launcher script for the [UO:Siege Perilous](https://game-master.net/) shard.
It installs and configures [ClassicUO](https://www.classicuo.eu/),
[Razor Community Edition (CE)](https://www.razorce.com/), and the required
Angel Island _"Golden Client"_ UO data files.

## TL;DR

```bash
# Install launcher
sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/local/bin/uo-siege-perilous-launcher \
    https://raw.github.com/ColloidSP/UOSPLinux/main/uo-siege-perilous-launcher
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/uo-siege-perilous-launcher

# Run launcher (creates an icon in your applications menu under "Games")
uo-siege-perilous-launcher

# Update UO:Siege Perilous (should be done occasionally)
uo-siege-perilous-launcher --update
```

## Words of Warning

**This code is currently in an alpha state! It works great for me, but reach out
to Colloid on the [UO:SP Discord](https://discord.gg/GwRuSV9vAb) to help with
testing.**

This launcher isn't officially supported by the UO:Siege Perilous team, however
the owner of the shard and I have discussed it. It's safe to say you won't be
banned for using it, however the UO:Siege Perilous team could block unofficial clients at any time. Use this launcher at your own risk, and be prepared to have to use the official Windows client in event that that happens.

## Installation

Download the launcher and mark it as executable,

```bash
sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/local/bin/uo-siege-perilous-launcher \
    https://raw.github.com/ColloidSP/UOSPLinux/main/uo-siege-perilous-launcher
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/uo-siege-perilous-launcher
```

## Running

To run the launcher, execute the command with your user account (ie **not** as root),

```bash
uo-siege-perilous-launcher
```

After it runs for the first time, a shortcut will be added to your Desktop
environment's application menu so you shoudn't need to use the terminal
(except to check for updates as below). It should be in the "Games" section,
or just search for "UO:Siege Perilous" on GNOME, which is what I do.

When running, ClassicUO may give the warning _"Your client is out of date. Please
update your client with the Launcher."_ This is a known issue and can be safely
ignored.

## Updates

To check for UO:Siege Perilous updates run,

```bash
uo-siege-perilous-launcher --update
```

## Self-Updating the Launcher

To update this command, run as root,

```bash
sudo uo-siege-perilous-launcher --self-update
```

## Help

For more information about how to use the launcher command,

```bash
uo-siege-perilous-launcher --help
```

## Requirements

* Python 3.8 or later (which your system very likely has installed)
* [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) &mdash; required for
  [Razor Community Edition](https://www.razorce.com/) only
* Support for only the x86_64 platform, ie amd64 or 64-bit

## Bonus: Running in Docker

You can also run ClassicUO and Razor in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.
The following uses the awesome
[`accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-opengl-g3`](https://github.com/accetto/headless-drawing-g3/blob/master/docker/xfce/README.md)
image as its base.
**This is for advanced users only who _already_ know how to use Docker.**

```
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/ColloidSP/UOSPLinux.git
cd UOSPLinux

# Build container image
docker build -t uo-siege-perilous .

# Run container, exposing port 6901
docker run --rm -d -p 6901:6901 --name uo-siege-perilous uo-siege-perilous

# Stop container
docker kill uo-siege-perilous
```

Then in your web browser head to <http://localhost:6901/>, and use the username
and password `headless`. Using the [Xfce](https://www.xfce.org/) desktop, open
_Applications > Games > UO:Siege Perilous_ and et voil√†!
